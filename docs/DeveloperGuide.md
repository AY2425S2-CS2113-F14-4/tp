## Design

EZMealPlan follows a modular and object-oriented design centered around a command-based architecture.

### Architecture Overview

EZMealPlan consists of the following main packages:
- `ezmealplan`: Initialises the app and starts the other components. Closes the other components upon exit  of the app. 
- `ui`: Captures user input and displays outputs via the command line.
- `parser`: Interprets user input and delegates to appropriate command classes.
- `command`: Represents different actions that can be executed. Commands have corresponding `checker`s that perform data
validation and error handling.
- `logic`: Interacts with the `meallist`. 
- `meallist`: Encapsulates meal storage and implements operations on them, such as adding, removing, and viewing meals.
- `food`: Represents meals and their subcomponents.
- `storage`: Initialises, saves, and loads data to and from the disk.

- Global logger is initialized in the `EZMealPlan` class.

- Functional classes use `logger.WARNING` for exceptions and `logger.SEVERE` for assertions.

- JUnit test classes use their own logger with `logger.INFO` for exceptions.

### `ezmealplan`
This package contains the main `EZMealPlan` class, which is the entrance point for the app.

It instantiates one `MealManager` and one `UserInterface`, which are shared across all other classes. It also
calls static methods in the `Command`, `Storage` and `Parser` classes. Below is a partial class diagram representing
the associations:
![EZMealPlanClass.png](diagrams/EZMealPlanClass.png)

This sequence diagram shows the processes that EZMealPlan system has to undergo while it is being booted up before it 
is ready for usage.
![BootingUpEZMealPlan.png](diagrams/BootingUpEZMealPlan.png)

This sequence diagram shows the procedures of extracting meals from the `recipesListFile` (`recipesList.txt`). A similar 
procedure follows for extracting meals from the `wishListFile` (`wishList.txt`).
![ConstructingMainMeals.png](diagrams/ConstructingMainMeals.png)

### `ui`

User input is captured by `readInput` in the `UserInterface` object, which is returned to `EZMealPlan`. `EZMealPlan`
calls the static method `parse` in `Parser` to process the input, which then creates the appropriate `Command` object.

This sequence diagram shows the general flow of how the EZMealPlan system process the respective command inputted by 
the user. Many relevant details and classes have been omitted for the purpose of simplicity. The implementations for 
the respective commands will be explained in greater details and illustrated with UML diagrams later.
![RunCommandSequenceDiagram.png](diagrams/RunCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

- All user inputs are case-sensitive and normalised to lowercase.

### `food`

The `food` package contains the abstract class `Product`, as well as `Ingredient` and `Meal` classes.

![Food.png](diagrams/Food.png)

The `Ingredient` class,
* Represents an ingredient, which has a `name` and `price`
* Contains the `setPrice` method, as well as private methods to check that 
the price provided is non-negative and able to be parsed as a `Double`

The `Meal` class,
* Represents a meal, which has a `name`, `price`, and `ingredientList` of type `List<Ingredient>`.
* Contains the `addIngredient` method that adds an `Ingredient` into its `ingredientList`. While doing so, it
also retrieves and adds the `price` of the `Ingredient` into the meal's `price`.
* Contains a private method that checks if an `Ingredient` to be added is already duplicated in the `ingredientList`, 
* and throws an exception.

### `command` 

The `command` package contains the abstract class `Command`, as well as various different subclasses that represent
specific commands, such as `CreateCommand`, `ByeCommand`, `HelpCommand`. The specific commands will be elaborated below.

Note that `FilterCommand` and `SelectCommand` inherit an abstract `FilterSelectCommand` class that inherits from 
`Command`. Similarly, `RemoveCommand` and `DeleteCommand` inherit an abstract `RemoveDeleteCommand`. This was 
done to abstract out similarities between the pairs of classes.

![CommandClass.png](diagrams/CommandClass.png)

### Enhancements in the Command Module

Both commands extend the abstract Command class, thereby following our command design pattern to decouple user input parsing from the actual execution of features. 
The primary objective of these commands is to ensure a clear separation of concerns, improve maintainability, and allow for easier testing.

#### 1. RecipesCommand

##### 1.1 Design Overview

###### Function
MealCommand is responsible for fetching the user meals from the MealManager and displaying them via the UserInterface.

###### Design Goals

**Single Responsibility:**
- RecipesCommand only deals with retrieving the user-selected meal list and forwarding it to the UI.

**Decoupling:**
- By isolating the command logic from both the UI and data management, future changes in either will have minimal impact.

**Testability:**
- The design allows for easy unit testing by injecting a test-specific UI that captures the output.

##### 1.2 Implementation Details

###### Component Level: RecipesCommand Class

- Inherits from the abstract Command class
- Implements the `execute(MealManager mealManager, UserInterface ui)` method
- Uses logging (via `logger.fine`) to trace execution
- Retrieves the user meal list using `mealManager.getUserMeals().getList()`
- Passes the list to the UI's `printMealList` method with the label "user chosen meals"

###### Code Example
```java
public void execute(MealManager mealManager, UserInterface ui) throws EZMealPlanException {
    assert mealManager != null : "MealManager cannot be null";
    logger.fine("Executing 'recipes' command");
    String recipesListName = mealManager.getRecipesList().getMealListName();
    List<Meal> recipesList = mealManager.getRecipesList().getList();
    ui.printMealList(recipesList, recipesListName);
}
```

##### 1.3 Sequence Diagram

![.\diagrams\RecipesCommand.png](.\diagrams\RecipesCommand.png)

##### 1.4 Unit Testing

###### Testing Approach
- A test-specific subclass of UserInterface (named TestUserInterface) is defined to capture the parameters passed to the `printMealList` method
- The unit test populates the MealManager's user meals list with sample meals
- Executes RecipesCommand
- Asserts that the UI received the expected label and list of meals

###### Unit Test Code
```java
@Test
public void testExecute_recipesCommand_printsRecipesList() throws EZMealPlanException {
    logger.fine("Running testExecute_recipesCommand_printsRecipesList()");
    MealManager mealManager = new MealManager();
    Meal meal1 = new Meal("Main Meal 1");
    Meal meal2 = new Meal("Main Meal 2");
    mealManager.getRecipesList().getList().add(meal1);
    mealManager.getRecipesList().getList().add(meal2);

    TestUserInterface testUI = new TestUserInterface();
    RecipesCommand recipesCommand = new RecipesCommand();
    recipesCommand.execute(mealManager, testUI);

    assertEquals(mealManager.getRecipesList().getMealListName(), testUI.capturedListName);
    List<Meal> expectedMeals = new ArrayList<>();
    expectedMeals.add(meal1);
    expectedMeals.add(meal2);
    assertIterableEquals(expectedMeals, testUI.capturedMeals);
    logger.info("testExecute_recipesCommand_printsRecipesList() passed");
}
```

#### 2. WishlistCommand

##### 2.1 Design Overview

###### Function
WishlistCommand fetches the main meal list from the MealManager and instructs the UI to display it.

###### Design Goals

**Single Responsibility:**
- WishlistCommand solely handles the retrieval and display of the main meals.

**Decoupling:**
- By segregating responsibilities, it makes the code easier to maintain and extend.

**Testability:**
- The design supports unit testing by allowing a test-specific UI to capture and verify the output.

##### 2.2 Implementation Details

###### Component Level: WishlistCommand Class

- Inherits from the abstract Command class
- Implements the `execute(MealManager mealManager, UserInterface ui)` method
- Uses logging to indicate execution
- Retrieves the main meal list using `mealManager.getMainMeals().getList()`
- Calls `ui.printMealList` with the label "main list"

###### Code Example
```java
public void execute(MealManager mealManager, UserInterface ui) throws EZMealPlanException {
    assert mealManager != null : "MealManager cannot be null";
    logger.fine("Executing 'wishlist' Command");
    List<Meal> wishList = mealManager.getWishList().getList();
    String wishListName = mealManager.getWishList().getMealListName();
    ui.printMealList(wishList, wishListName);
}
```

##### 2.3 Sequence Diagram

![.\diagrams\WishlistCommand.png](./diagrams/WishlistCommand.png)

##### 2.4 Unit Testing

###### Testing Approach
- Uses a test-specific TestUserInterface subclass to capture the output of `printMealList`
- Sets up the main meal list in the MealManager
- Executes WishlistCommand
- Verifies that the UI output matches the expected label and meal list

###### Unit Test Code
```java
@Test
public void testExecute_wishlistCommand_printsUserChosenMeals() throws EZMealPlanException {
    logger.fine("running testExecute_wishlistCommand_printsUserChosenMeals()");
    MealManager mealManager = new MealManager();
    Meal meal1 = new Meal("Meal A");
    Meal meal2 = new Meal("Meal B");
    mealManager.getWishList().getList().add(meal1);
    mealManager.getWishList().getList().add(meal2);

    TestUserInterface testUI = new TestUserInterface();
    WishlistCommand wishlistCommand = new WishlistCommand();
    wishlistCommand.execute(mealManager, testUI);

    assertEquals(mealManager.getWishList().getMealListName(), testUI.capturedListName);
    List<Meal> expectedMeals = new ArrayList<>();
    expectedMeals.add(meal1);
    expectedMeals.add(meal2);
    assertIterableEquals(expectedMeals, testUI.capturedMeals);
    logger.fine("testExecute_wishlistCommand_printsUserChosenMeals() passed");
}
```

#### 3. SelectCommand

##### 3.1 Design Overview

###### Function
SelectCommand allows the user to select a recipe from the filtered list (obtained via the FilterCommand) by providing its index, and then adds the selected recipe into the user's wish list.

###### Design Goals
- **Single Responsibility:**
    - SelectCommand is solely responsible for validating the user-provided index, retrieving the corresponding recipe from the filtered list, and adding that recipe to the wish list.

- **Decoupling:**
    - By isolating the selection logic from other commands, it becomes easier to maintain and extend without affecting other parts of the system.

- **Testability:**
    - The design supports unit testing by using a test-specific UserInterface subclass to capture the output, allowing us to verify that the correct recipe is added to the wish list and the appropriate confirmation message is displayed.

##### 3.2 Implementation Details

###### Component Level: SelectCommand Class
- Inherits from the abstract FilterSelectCommand class.
- Implements the execute(MealManager mealManager, UserInterface ui) method.
- Uses logging to indicate execution and to record any input validation issues.
- Validates the user input index using helper methods (getIndexSubstring, checkValidParse, and checkValidInputIndex).
- Retrieves the filtered meal list via the inherited method getFilteredMealList(mealManager).
- Retrieves the wish list from the MealManager.
- Adds the selected recipe to the wish list and calls ui.printAddMealMessage to display a confirmation message.

###### Code Example
```java
    public void execute(MealManager mealManager, UserInterface ui) throws EZMealPlanException {
        boolean isValidUserInput = checkValidUserInput(filterOrSelect);
        if (!isValidUserInput) {
            logger.severe("Huge issue detected! The user input format remains invalid despite " +
                    "passing all the checks for input formatting error.");
        }
        assert isValidUserInput;
        List<Meal> filteredMealList = getFilteredMealList(mealManager);
        if (filteredMealList.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("The filtered meal list is empty.");
            return;
        }
        String indexSubstring = getIndexSubstring();
        int inputIndex = checkValidParse(indexSubstring);
        Meal selectedMeal = checkValidInputIndex(inputIndex, filteredMealList);
        MealList wishList = mealManager.getWishList();
        mealManager.addMeal(selectedMeal, wishList);
        ui.printAddMealMessage(selectedMeal, wishList);
    }
```
##### 3.3 Sequence Diagram
Below is the UML sequence diagram for the SelectCommand, illustrating its interactions with the system components:

![.\diagrams\SelectCommand.png](.\diagrams\SelectCommand.png)

##### 3.4 Unit Testing

###### Testing Approach
- Tests are divided into success and failure scenarios using separate test methods
- A custom logger is set up to track test execution with both console and file handlers
- For successful selection tests:
  - Tests run on both empty and populated meal lists
  - Multiple selection command formats are tested (/mname, /ing, /mcost)
- For failure scenarios, tests verify appropriate exceptions are thrown for:
  - Invalid index formats (non-numeric values)
  - Out-of-range indices (negative, zero, or beyond list size)
  - Invalid price formats and negative prices
  - Duplicate meal selections (attempting to add the same meal twice)
- The test utilizes preset meals loaded from Storage to populate the meal list
- Each test verifies expected exception messages match actual exception messages
-
###### Unit Test Code
```java
@Test
public void selectCommand_success() {
    mealManager.getRecipesList().getList().clear();
    mealManager.getWishList().getList().clear();
    logger.fine("running selectCommand_success()");
    String[] validSelectCommands = {"select 2 /mname a", "select 1 /ing b,c", "select 2 /mcost 2"
            , "select 4 /mname Mname", "select 2 /ing Ing", "select 1 /mcost 5"};
    runValidSelectCommands(validSelectCommands);
    addMeals();
    runValidSelectCommands(validSelectCommands);
    logger.info("selectCommand_success() passed");
}

@Test
public void selectCommand_fail() {
    logger.fine("running selectCommand_fail()");
    mealManager.getRecipesList().getList().clear();
    mealManager.getWishList().getList().clear();
    addMeals();
    checkInvalidPrice();
    checkSelectDuplicateMeal();
    checkInvalidSelectIndex();
    checkIndexOutOfRange();
    logger.info("selectCommand_fail() passed");
}
```

### 4. CreateCommand and CreateChecker

##### 4.1 Design Overview

###### Function
CreateChecker checks if the user input is valid before passing to the CreateCommand to create a new meal from the user input and adds it into the recipes list.

###### Design Goals

**Single Responsibility:**
- CreateCommand solely handles the creation and adding of new meal into the recipes list while
CreateChecker solely handles checking of the Create command input by the user.

**Decoupling:**
- By segregating responsibilities, it makes the code easier to maintain and extend.

**Testability:**
- The design supports unit testing by allowing test-specific CreateCommandTest and CreateCheckerTest to capture and verify the output.

##### 4.2 Implementation Details

###### Component Level: CreateChecker Class

- Inherits from the abstract Checker Class.
- Implements the `check()` method.
- Uses logging to indicate execution.
- `isPassed` is set to `true` once the user input passes all the required checks.
- Passes the valid user input back into the CreateCommand class for processing into a new meal.

###### Component Level: CreateCommand Class

- Inherits from the abstract Command class.
- Implements the `execute(MealManager mealManager, UserInterface ui)` method.
- Uses logging to indicate execution.
- Creates a new meal and passes it to the MealManager for adding the meal into the recipes list.

###### Code Example
```java
@Override
public void check() throws EZMealPlanException {
    logger.fine("Checking '" + userInput + "' for errors.");
    checkMnameExists();
    checkIngExists();
    checkMnameIngIndexes();
    checkMealNameExists();
    checkIngredientExists();
    checkIngredientFormat();
    setPassed(true);
}
```
```java
 @Override
    public void execute(MealManager mealManager, UserInterface ui) throws EZMealPlanException {
        boolean isValidUserInput = checkValidUserInput();
        if (!isValidUserInput) {
            logger.severe("Huge issue detected! The user input format remains invalid despite " +
                    "passing all the checks for input formatting error.");
        }
        assert isValidUserInput;

        Meal newMeal = createNewMeal();
        MealList recipesList = mealManager.getRecipesList();
        mealManager.addMeal(newMeal, recipesList);
        ui.printAddMealMessage(newMeal, recipesList);
    }
```
##### 4.3 Sequence Diagrams
Here are Sequence Diagrams depicting the flow of the proceesing of user inputs into a new meal:
![CreateCommand.puml](puml/CreateCommand.puml)
![CreateChecker.puml](puml/CreateChecker.puml)
##### 4.4 Unit Testing

###### Testing Approach
- Uses a test-specific CreateCheckerTest and CreateCommandTest to ensure that the CreateChecker and CreateCommand account for different types of user inputs and proceed as normal.
- Test with different types of user inputs that gives no error and some exceptions.
- Executes CreateChecker and CreateCommand.
- Verifies that the exceptions are thrown according to the user inputs.

###### Unit Test Code
```java
 @Test
public void createCommand_fail() {
    logger.fine("running createCommand_fail()");
    duplicate_ingredient_catch();
    duplicate_meal_catch();
    invalidPriceFormat();
    logger.info("createCommand_fail() test passed");
}
```
```java
@Test
    public void createChecker_fail() {
        logger.fine("Running createChecker_fail()");
        checkMissingMname();
        checkMissingIng();
        checkInvalidCreateIndex();
        checkInvalidIngMnameIndex();
        checkMissingMealName();
        checkMissingIngredient();
        checkInvalidIngredientFormat();
        logger.info("createChecker_fail() passed");
    }
```

#### 4. DeleteCommand

##### 4.1 Design Overview

###### Function
DeleteCommand is responsible for removing a specific meal from the main meal list and, if applicable, also removing the same meal from the user's wish list. It ensures consistency between related lists and provides user feedback via the UserInterface.

###### Design Goals

 **Consistency**

- Ensures that if a meal is deleted from the main list, it is also removed from the wish list to prevent dangling references.

**Single Responsibility**

- Focuses purely on deletion logic while relying on MealManager for list access and UserInterface for message display.

**Extensibility**

- Built on top of the shared abstract class RemoveDeleteCommand, which allows common functionality (like index parsing and list access) to be reused across similar commands (e.g., RemoveCommand).

##### 4.2 Implementation Details

###### Component Level: DeleteCommand Class

- Inherits from the abstract `RemoveDeleteCommand` class
- Implements the `execute(MealManager mealmanager, UserInterface ui)` method
- Uses logging (via `logger.fine(...)` to indicate successful deletion.
- Retrieves the main meal list using `mealManager.getMainMeals()` (inherited logic)
- Removes the meal at the specified index (inherited logic)
- Retrieves the wish list using `mealManager.getWishList()`
- Checks if the deleted meal exists in the wish list using `wishlist.contains(...)`
- If it exists, removes it using `wishList.removeMeal(...)`
- Calls `ui.printRemovedMessage(...)` to notify the user of removal from the wish list

###### Code Example
```java
@Override
    public void execute(MealManager mealManager, UserInterface ui) throws EZMealPlanException {
        super.execute(mealManager, ui);
        Meals userMeals = mealManager.getUserMeals();
        if (userMeals.contains(removedOrDeletedMeal)) {
            int indexInUserList = userMeals.getIndex(removedOrDeletedMeal);
            userMeals.removeMeal(indexInUserList);
            ui.printRemovedMessage(removedOrDeletedMeal, userMeals.size());
            logger.fine("Command finished executing: Removed \"" + removedOrDeletedMeal.getName() + "\" meal " +
                    "from user list");
        }
        logger.fine("Command finished executing: Deleted \"" + removedOrDeletedMeal.getName() + "\" meal from " +
                "main list");
    }
```
