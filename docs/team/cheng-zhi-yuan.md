## Overview
EZMealPlan is a CLI-based system that helps users to plan their meals. Users can view a list of pre-created meals in the main
recipes list, filter them by meal name, ingredients and cost according to their personal preferences, and add them
into their personal wishlist. Users can also create their own meals which will be added into the recipes list and remove meals from their personal wishlist and the main recipes list.
